          <p class="hello">Hello! My name is Alex. I love playing video games, it is a hobby of mine.</p>
          <p>I first started playing video games when I was quite young. I have loved it ever since. Video games aren't the only thing I do in my free time, however. </p>
          <p>I also spend time with my friends and family, and am a member of a club in which I am one of the two officers out of the 60 people in the club! In the club, </p>
          <p>we go to builds and help repair houses. We also hold walkathons to raise money for the nonprofit. I like tennis, as well. I also try my hardest in school, maintaining high grades. </p>
