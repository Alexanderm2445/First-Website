          <p class="hello">Hello! My name is Alex. I love playing video games, it is a hobby of mine.</p>
          <p>I first started playing video games when I was quite young. I have loved it ever since. Video games aren't the only thing I do in my free time, however. </p>
          <p>I also spend time with my friends and family, and am a member of a club in which I am one of the two officers out of the 60 people in the club! I also hope to </p>
          <p>get involved in other clubs such as the Web Design Club, Coding Club, and being a member of the backstage crew in the Theatre Club. Something else I enjoy is playing tennis. </p> 
          <p>I also try my hardest in school, maintaining high grades. </p>
