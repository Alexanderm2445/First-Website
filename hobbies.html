        <p class="hello">Hello! As aforementioned, I like playing videogames. Specifically, however, I like horror games! They have always</p>
        <p>kept me at the edge of my seat. My favorite horror video game is the Five Nights at Freddy's series. It is also getting a</p>
        <p>movie soon which I am very excited for. Anyways, the series has always caught my attention, even when I was young and got</p>
        <p>nightmares easily (what a great idea for me to play it, then). I do also play games that draw on creativity, however, like 
        <p>Minecraft, where you can use a various assortment of blocks to create things that look amazing!</p>

         <p class="hello">Habitat for Humanity is the name of the aforementioned club at my school. I like the club because it feels rewarding</p>
         <p>to go to worksites such as houses and churches and help fix them for the usage of the people. I said before that also, I am an officer</p>
         <p>which entails myself and the other officer having to go to monthly meetings with other schools about our builds, along with doing other</p>
         <p>things such as helping schedule our next builds. I also have to attend almost all of the builds to further prove that I am a club leader.</p>
         <p>We also hold walkathons to raise money, which is important for our club.</p>

        <p class="hello">There really isn't too much to this one, I just think that space is interesting and that there is still so much that we don't</p>
        <p>know about it. There is a lot that could be done in my lifetime that could be really cool to see. I am also interested by the thought of aliens</p>
        <p>and maybe, if I'm lucky, seeing them in my lifetime.</p>
